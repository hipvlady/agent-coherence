"""Disclosure parity — a limitation admitted in a docstring is admitted to users.

Two shipped concurrency limitations were disclosed in source docstrings while the
user-facing docs described only the narrower case. A reader of the docs could not
learn what a reader of the source could.

This guards both directions, and it is deliberately two mechanisms rather than one:

* ``PINS`` ties each known disclosure to the user-doc sentence that carries it, so
  deleting either side fails here rather than silently widening the gap.
* ``test_every_disclosure_marker_is_pinned`` scans for the marker vocabulary the
  codebase uses for these admissions and fails on any occurrence that is not
  pinned. That is what catches the NEXT one — a new limitation cannot land
  disclosed only in source.

A generic detector is not possible: the two known disclosures share no phrasing.
The pin table is the honest form of the check.
