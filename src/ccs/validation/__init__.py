"""Log validation helpers for CCS materialized JSONL event streams.

Gap-detection model
-------------------
Three values together make a gap-detectable stream:

* ``sequence_number`` — a per-stream monotonic int starting at 1, incrementing
  by 1 for each emitted entry.  CCS guarantees no gaps in its own emission; a
  gap means at least one entry was dropped *after* emission (e.g. partial write,
  truncation, or line deletion).
* ``instance_id`` — a UUID4 string fixed for one ``CCSStore`` session.  When
  ``instance_id`` changes, ``validate_log`` resets its counter.  A
  ``sequence_number`` returning to 1 at a session boundary is not a gap.
* ``schema_version`` — a constant string (e.g. ``"ccs.state_log.v1"``) that
  names the emitting surface.  Pass the expected value to ``validate_log`` to
  catch schema drift.

"Missing" vs "unset" vs "skipped":  all three map to the same wire
representation only when the emitter conflates them.  CCS never emits entries
with missing fields; consumers should treat ``ValueError`` from ``validate_log``
as "producer bug or pre-upgrade line," not "clean log."

Upgrade-boundary limitation:
  JSONL files that span a CCS upgrade boundary (pre-upgrade entries lack
  ``sequence_number`` / ``instance_id``) will raise ``ValueError`` on the
  first old-format entry. Split the log at the upgrade boundary before calling
  ``validate_log``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    path:
        Path to a JSONL file written by CCS (state log or metrics stream).
    stream:
        A caller-supplied label written into returned ``Gap`` and
        ``SchemaMismatch`` objects. Passing ``"metrics"`` on a state log file
        produces no error — the parameter is a label, not a filter.
    schema_version:
        When provided, each entry's ``schema_version`` field must match this
        value; mismatches are appended to the returned ``SchemaMismatch`` list.
        When ``None`` (the default), schema version checking is skipped.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If any line is missing ``sequence_number``, ``instance_id``, or
        (when *schema_version* is not ``None``) ``schema_version``. The scan
        aborts at the first missing field; any gaps found before that line are
        discarded.
    json.JSONDecodeError
        If any line is not valid JSON. Propagated to the caller; no partial
        result is returned.
